Ripping DVDs is annoying.  Ripping TV show DVDs even more so. This script minimizes one annoying aspect - some TV DVDs have a bunch of extra shorts etc.

The ripper spits these out in a format like:

title01.mkv
title02.mkv
title03.mkv
...

This script lets you specify a series, a season and a starting episode, and the script will rename them appropriately.

# TODO invocation instructions, etc.
